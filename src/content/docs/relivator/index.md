**🙏 Please help us reach 1,000 stars on GitHub**: Once this project reaches this goal, I, @blefnk, the author of this project, will start my video course on the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, JS), React, Next.js, TypeScript, related libraries, and many other topics. This milestone will also affirm that Relivator and [Reliverse](https://github.com/blefnk/reliverse-website-builder) truly make sense to exist, leading to more frequent updates and further dedication to these projects.

**⭐ Bookmark this page in your browser**: This project will only get better in the future. You can also click the star at the top of the page and add the repo to your collection to keep it easily accessible.

We are currently migrating the documentation from the existing Relivator README.md to the official, newly launched [Relivator & Reliverse Docs website (https://reliverse.org)](https://reliverse.org). The content will be organized into appropriate sections on the new site. During the migration, some elements might not function properly. The current README.md will contain only minimal information. Please let us know if you encounter any issues.

Our goal is to create the world's most feature-rich and globally accessible Next.js starter. It offers more than just code—it's an experience. Scroll down to see the impressive list of project features, including the ability to switch between Clerk/Auth.js (next-auth@beta/NextAuth.js) and Drizzle's MySQL/PostgreSQL on the fly. Welcome to the Relivator starter and the Reliverse community!
