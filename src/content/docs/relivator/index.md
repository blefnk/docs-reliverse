We are currently migrating the documentation from the existing Relivator README.md to the official, newly launched [Relivator & Reliverse Docs website (https://reliverse.org)](https://reliverse.org). The content will be organized into appropriate sections on the new site. During the migration, some elements might not function properly. The current README.md will contain only minimal information. Please let us know if you encounter any issues.

The entire Relivator project was developed by one person, [Nazar Kornienko (blefnk)](https://github.com/blefnk)! Some people have already contributed, and you’re welcome to do the same—any contributions at all are appreciated!

Thank you all for your contributions and [financial support](./SPONSORS.md)!

Our goal is to create the world's most feature-rich and globally accessible Next.js starter. It offers more than just code—it's an experience. Scroll down to see the impressive list of project features, including the ability to switch between Clerk/Auth.js (next-auth@beta/NextAuth.js) and Drizzle's MySQL/PostgreSQL on the fly. Welcome to the Relivator starter and the Reliverse community!
